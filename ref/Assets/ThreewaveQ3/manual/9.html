  </font>
  <p><b>What does the portal do for Quake? What IS the portal?</b>
  <p>The Portal lets you throw up maps and/or any ThreeWave supported gametypes
  so people can walk through teleporters and vote for their favourite games.
  <p><b>Okay, but how does that work in the game?</b>
  <p>More specifically, everyone spawns in a small chamber. Around them is a
  number of portals (between 8 and 64 depending on the map). Each one has a
  graphic of a map on it.
  <p>Once the first player jumps through, a timer starts counting down. The
  player ends up in a 'minigame', which is a goofy interpretation of the rules
  of Quake in a small room. This should be chaotic.
  <p>When that timer runs out, if the gametype voting is to happen, everyone is
  spawned into the backend of the space station where they vote for their
  favourite mode of play.
  <p>Then the map ends as quickly as possible and the real map comes up in it's
  place.
  <h3><font color="#f0f0a0" size="4">Quickstart</font></h3>
  <p><b>I just installed ThreeWave CTF and I want to run a quick and dirty
  portal server for a LAN, how do I get up and running real fast?</b>
  <p>ThreeWave CTF ships with two premade portal configs. Do your normal server
  config parameters, but append <tt>+exec portal.cfg</tt> for the CTF portal or <tt>+exec
  dm-portal.cfg</tt> to your string.
  <p><b>I want to rip out the ability to vote for a specific gametype, but I
  like map voting. What do I change in the config file?</b>
  <p>Set <tt>p_gameTypeVote</tt> to 0 in the aforementioned config. Then set <tt>p_defaultGametype</tt>
  to your preferred game. The list of supported types is as follows:
  <ul>
    <li>0 - Free For All
    <li>1 - Tournament (one on one)
    <li>3 - Team Deathmatch
    <li>4 - ThreeWave CTF
    <li>9 - CaptureStrike
    <li>10- Classic CTF</li>
  </ul>
  <i>You don't want to use a number that isn't in this list.</i> The other types
  are not supported.
  <h3><font face="Arial" color="#f0f0a0" size="4">Using the portal for more than
  Capturing Flags</font></h3>
  <p><b>I've heard that the ThreeWave portal is good for more than just choosing
  CTF games. What is the extent of it's massive powers?</b>
  <p>Cough. Well, you can throw any map you want in for voting on the portal. As
  soon as you change a single console variable and type <tt>map_restart</tt> on
  the server, everyone on the server will see the new graphic.
  <p>Make sure everyone on the server is likely to have the map! If they don't,
  they will get disconnected (or auto download) if it gets voted in.
  <p>The same thing applies for gametypes. You can mix and match the possible
  gametypes that you can vote for.
  <p><b>I want to run a portal server with custom maps. How do I do this?</b>
  <p>Relatively simple. When you would normally type 'map &lt;mapname&gt;' on
  the server to load a map, you would add it to your portal config file in a
  different fashion. There are 64 portal variables named p_portalMap01 through
  p_portalMap64. Each one represents a portal, and you can change one of them to
  the name of your new map (sans '.bsp').
  <p>Note that if the particular portal that you're playing on has less than 64
  portals, some of the p_portalMap console variables will be irrelevant to your
  players.
  <p>For example, adding q3tourney6 to the 12th portal would be done like this:
  <p><tt>p_portalMap12 &quot;q3tourney6&quot;</tt>
  <p><b>Okay, that's maps, but how do I change the gametypes?</b>
  <p>There are five gametype portals. The console variables that apply to them
  (see above) are p_gtPortal01 through p_gtPortal05. Set these to -1 to disable
  each one, or to one of the gametype values above. For example:
  <pre><tt>
seta p_gtPortal01 &quot;-1&quot; // Disabled
seta p_gtPortal02 &quot;4&quot;  // CTF
seta p_gtPortal03 &quot;9&quot;  // CaptureStrike
seta p_gtPortal04 &quot;10&quot; // Classic CTF 
seta p_gtPortal05 &quot;-1&quot; // Disabled
</tt></pre>
  <h3><font color="#f0f0a0" size="4">Removing Maps</font></h3>
  <p><b>I have somewhat negative feelings towards a map. How do I remove one
  from being votable?</b></p>
  <p>In the true nature of democracy, you can pre-emptively deny the winning of
  a map. The best way of doing this is to throw a big 'X' over the map so people
  know it was there, and they can't vote now. You can do that by adding to a
  comma separated list known as <tt>p_disablePortalList</tt>. Say you wanted to
  disable <tt>p_portalMap</tt> three, fifty and twelve:
  <p><tt>p_disablePortalList &quot;03,50,12&quot;</tt></p>
  <p><b>How come some halls are blocked in the 64 portal map?</b><font size="0">
  <p></font>
  <p>If no portals in a hallway are activated with a p_portalMap## console
  variable, the hallway is blocked to save the time of those who would wander
  in.
  <h3><font color="#f0f0a0" size="4">Customizing the Portal Experience Further</font></h3>
  <p><b>I noticed there is a random portal. How does it work and how can I
  remove/add it?</b>
  <p>The random portal ships enabled. Every user who goes through it will vote
  for a random map that is enabled on the server at that time. Every user will
  also be voting for the SAME random map.
  <p>Use the console variable p_randomPortal to enable or disable the random
  portal.
  <p><b>How do I change how long a minigame plays for?</b>
  <p><tt>p_voteSeconds</tt> is the number of seconds. This defaults to sixty.
  <p><b>How do I disable the portal altogether?</b>
  <p>Use <tt>p_enablePortal</tt> 0, and you can have your map rotation back.
  <h3><font color="#f0f0a0" size="4">Callvoting and other means of getting
  around</font></h3>
  <b>
  <p>Does the portal have to come back after every map?</b>
  <p>Right now, the portal comes back after every map for another vote. We are
  looking into additional methods for possible future releases.<b>
  <p>I want to callvote a map, but I can't. How do I callvote a map?</b>
  <p>You callvote a map by turning the portal off with <tt>p_enablePortal 0</tt>.
  Or else, you can callvote portal from the menu to go back to the portal
  immediately.
  <p><b>I'm at the server console. How do I bring the server back to the portal?</b>
  <p>Type <tt>vstr GotoPortal</tt>, and it will load. This is similar to typing <tt>vstr
  nextmap</tt> when the portal isn't loaded and you have a map rotation like a
  normal server.
