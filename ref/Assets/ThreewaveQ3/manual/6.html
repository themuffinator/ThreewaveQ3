      <H3><font color="#f0f0a0" face="Arial" size="4">Overview</font></H3><p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2">The portal is used to vote for maps
      and gametypes between maps.<br>
      After the map voting, players will be transported to one of several minigame rooms to play until the voting times out.<br>
      If the server admin allows it, players will then be informed of the voted map, and will be allowed to vote for a gametype to play the voted map in, such as CTF, CtfS, and Classic CTF. The portal can also be used for Team DM, FFA Deathmatch and Tournament one vs one play.<br>
                      As of version 1.5, we have added an 'episode portal' which
                      allows server admins to assemble 4 episodes of levels
                      containing up to 8 levels to be played in succession in
                      the same gametype before returning to the portal level to
                      vote for another episode.</font></p>

  </FONT>
      <P><font face="Arial" size="2">- Players spawn in one of the portal maps and have an opportunity to vote for a map
      of their choice.<br>
      <br>
      - You should be able to see an image for a level in each of the portals, if not, aiming your crosshair at the portal will pop-up an image on your screen of the level that the portal contains.<br>
      <br>
      - On the large 'Portal 64' level, if a hallway doesn't contain any votable maps, it will be blocked off.<br>
      <br>
      - The smaller 'Portal 8' level, has 8 portals which can be used for 8 pre-selected maps,
      and the 'Portal16' level allows 16 different maps to be chosen from.<br>
      <br>
      - After observing the available maps, players will walk through the portal that corresponds to their level of choice to vote for it.<br>
      <br>
      - There is also a Random portal which votes for one unknown map or episode that has been randomly chosen at the start of the portal cycle. All players who chose the Random portal are in effect voting for the same randomly chosen map.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      - Portals for some maps and the random portal can be disabled by the admin, and will be covered by an impassable 'X'<br>
      <br>
      - The new level 'q3start2' is the Episode portal. In this level, there are
      four sections, each of which is an episode of levels to vote for. All the
      levels in the hallway will be played in succession before returning to the
      episode portal.<br>
      <br>
      - If you see portals with a faint Threewave logo, then it is likely that you don't have that map, and will have to download it. If the server has autodownload enabled, you may use that to get the missing map, or you may choose to go to the website URL in the server MOTD to get the missing
      map, or check <a href="http://www.threewave.com">www.threewave.com</a> for
      popular maps that are found on most servers.<br>
      <br>
      - Currently there are 4 minigames. All players will be playing in the same mini-game, which is chosen by the server at the start of the vote cycle. The LavaDoom minigame only appears in the Portal08
      and portal20 due to Quake3 limitations.<br>
      <br>
      - Following the minigame, if the server admin allows it, you will spawn in
      a gametype voting area where you will be shown the map that won the
      voting, and may choose which gametype to play the map in.</font><P><font face="Arial" size="2">- At the conclusion of the Vote cycle, the chosen
                      level or episode of levels, and gametype will load.</font>
      <H3><font color="#f0f0a0" face="Arial" size="4">Minigames</font></H3>
      <P><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>1) Gauntlet Fest:</b> Players will compete for the quad damage and kills with only their skills and their gauntlet.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2) Silly Quad:</b> Players receive 2 points for getting a silly quad, and 1 point for killing other players while they have the silly quad. When picked up, another silly quad  will spawn elsewhere in the level in roughly 2 seconds. Get as many silly quads as you can to get the most points, but be warned, the silly quad distorts your screen making it difficult to maneuver and to kill other players. The silly quad effect will last for 10 seconds. Players who do not have the silly quad do not receive points for killing other players, nor do any players lose points for falling off into the void. Players will spawn with a railgun, shotgun, and machinegun.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3) LavaDoom:</b> The floor in this minigame is made up of many individual pieces. Shooting one of these pieces will cause it and anybody who is on it to fall to their death in the lava. If a player dies in a hole in the floor that you have created you will receive a point. After 1 to 2 seconds, depending on the number of players in the game, the floor pieces will come back up and reset. Players will spawn with a railgun and ammo. You cannot damage other players with the railgun, you can only use it to shoot out floor pieces below players to gain points. You will not lose points for falling to your death in the lava, unless you fall in one of the 6 colored holes present on the level. If you can master the technique, you can resort to crouching and using your gauntlet to activate the floor pieces beneath you and an opponent, but this takes skill and fast reflexes. This minigame only appears in the Portal08 map.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <b>4) Pineapple Fury:</b> Players will spawn in a three level open room and will be given the Haste powerup on spawn. At the bottom of the pit is four bouncepads and a quickly respawning Grenade Launcher that comes pre-loaded with 50 grenades. You can either venture down into the pit to get a grenade launcher and try to bounce back up, or use your gauntlet to kill players who are more focused on spamming grenades. It's non stop mayhem.</font>
                      <P align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>5) Greed:</b> Players
                      spawn in a coin filled arena with Rocket and Rail and
                      constantly have the regen powerup making it more difficult
                      to be killed. The object is to run around and collect as
                      many coins as you can before the end of the level. The
                      player with the most coins at the end of the level wins.
                      Any damage you receive will cause some of your coins to
                      pop out, relative to the amount of damage. Be careful, if
                      you die, you will lose all your coins and have to start
                      over. You can steal other players coins by shooting or
                      killing them and then picking up the coins that pop out.
                      There are three types of coins in this minigame, small, medium,
                      and large, with each larger sized coin being worth more,
                      and the largest coin being extremely hard to reach.&nbsp;</font><P align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>6)
                      Skeet Shoot Alley:</b> Players will spawn in a confined
                      booth with a railgun and have an opportunity to shoot
                      other players flying through the air like skeet. If you
                      miss a player, and they make it to the colored targets,
                      they receive 5 points. While you only get one point for
                      each player you kill, it wont be long before it's your
                      turn to be flung through the air like skeet hoping to make
                      it to the 5 point colored targets. Once your turn as skeet
                      is up, you're back in the booth to repeat the cycle.</font>
