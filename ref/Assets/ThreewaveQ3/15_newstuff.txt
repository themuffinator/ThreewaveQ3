New colors for models and names
- there are new colors you can use for your name or model, they are
  < 8-9-a-b-c-d-e-f >

Colored player models
- once you set cg_usepromodeskins 1, you can select colors for your models
  color          : set colors for your own model
  cg_enemyColors : set colors for your enemies
  cg_forceColors : force your teammates to use your colors instead of theirs
  setting colors follows this scheme : <WEAPON EFFECTS><HEAD><TORSO><LEGS><RAIL CORE>
  i.e.: set color "35db9"

Radio
- vosay,vosay_team have been removed (voice only), if you wish to replace text in a voice
  command, you do it like so: /vsay haha "LOL!"
  by adding your replacement text after the vsay, if you dont the default string will be used
- new autoradio system, cg_autoradio 1 (by default) you will send messages upon certain events
  to your teammates, such as:
  * Getting the flag (event_gotflag)
  * Getting the quad damage (event_gotquad)
  * Seeing the enemy flag carrier (event_seecarrier)
  * Dropping items for your teammates (event_droprune,event_dropweapon,event_dropammo,
    event_droparmor,event_dropflag)
  Note: by setting the event_* cvars you can customize what is automatically said to your
  teammates, i.e.: /set event_droprune "vsay droprune; say_team I am dropping the $e rune!"
- new item reporting system, you can now automatically tell your teammates if an item is
  available by standing next to the item and doing /reportitem (you can bind this command)
  * Mega health available (event_megaavail)
  * Armor available (event_armoravail)
  * Rune available (event_runeavail)
  * Item available (event_itemavail)
  Note: here like in autoradio you can customize the messages sent by changing the cvars event_*

More automation
- Automatically take a screenshot of the scoreboard at match end with cg_autoScreenshot 1
- Automatically record every match you play from start to finish with cg_autoRecord 1

Callvote-ing
- Give a reason with your votes by adding extra text after the callvote commmand
  i.e.: /callvote kick Jimbo he is not playing!

Switching teams
- No need to switch to spectator to switch teams in Capture Strike

Statistics
- you can get more precise stats if you call it like this : /stats -precise

Portals in general:
- may now specify a set of gametypes for every portal using p_portalGametypesXX
  where XX is the number of the portal for which these gametypes will be used, you 
  set them like so (lets say we want p_portalMap10 to be playable in capture strike 
  and 1flag) : set p_portalGametypes10 "-1,9,-1,5,-1"
- for the regular portal, you can now specify the amount of last voted maps disabled
  by setting the number in p_disableLastPlayedPortals
  
Episode portal:
- 4 groups of 1 to 8 maps that will cycle, groups are 01->08, 09->16, 17->24, 25->32
- first portal of each group must be set, or else that episode will be disabled
- to specify a specific set of gametypes for one episode, set the gametype string for the first
  map in that episode
- enable it by using q3start2 and setting p_enablePortal 2
