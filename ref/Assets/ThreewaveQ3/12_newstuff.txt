cg_acceptVoiceOnly [0,1]
- sets wether you will accept receiving voice only messages (no text)

cg_forceVoice [0...3]
- force every voice message you receive to use the specified voice

cg_teamVoiceOnly [0,1]
- if this is enabled you will only receive voice messages from your team

cg_predictGrapple [0,1]
- if this cvar is on your grapple movement will be predicted by the client and the server,
good idea for HPBs to leave it on, if it is off, only the server will decide your movement
hence having a "true-er" position in the game (only for LPBs)
