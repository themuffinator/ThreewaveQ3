Warning: 
Playing Capture the Flag will result in death, injury or property damage. 
We are not responsible for loss of employment, motivation, marital disruption, 
monitor stains, health degradation, hair loss, repetitive stress injury, 
musculoskeletal disorders, or any other problems that may result from 
overexposure to Capture the Flag. You should consult your physician before 
playing Capture the Flag or engaging in any strenuous activity. 
Some Capture the Flag players may experience side effects such as an 
increased need to urinate while you have the flag, upgrade obsession disorder, 
or selective spousal memory loss while playing. In a controlled study, 
the need to urinate was only 20% greater than players whose flag was replaced 
with a placebo. Selective spousal memory loss was only 1% greater than players 
who didn't play Capture the Flag. Some levels require additional assembly 
and should not be used by children under the age of 12 without the constant 
supervision of an adult. Safety equipment should be worn at all times while 
playing Capture the Flag, and warm up exercises should be performed for at 
least fifteen minutes before logging onto a public Capture the Flag server. 
Failure to follow any of these warnings will result in serious injury. 
If you experience any form of injury or discomfort while playing 
Capture the Flag you should report this problem to a qualified medical 
practitioner immediately. Levels are not exactly as shown, and may vary 
in your area. We cannot guarantee security or privacy of any commands, 
messages or packets sent over the Internet to game servers. 
Do not send any sensitive data through this medium that you would not 
want seen by outside parties. 
Please have a nice day, and enjoy playing Capture the Flag.
