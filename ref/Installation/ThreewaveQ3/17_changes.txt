3w 1.7 (29/03/2004)
====================================================================
- add: CCTF, two new runes, vampire and grapple
       -vampire gives health to the user when he damages enemies (75% of health damage)
        it can also take some health from shooting dead corpses
       -grapple gives a bonus of 100 to shoot and 100 to pull speeds
       ( g_cctfNewRunes, default:1 -> enabled )
- add: offhand grapple (g_offhandgrapple 1 on server, clients use +button5 to use)
- add: added matchmode, lockteams and coaching to votes, you need to enable 
       "matchmode" votes by adding 128 to the g_allowVote cvar on the server
- add: g_ctfs_roundswap cvar and worldspawn flag "ctfs_roundswap" that makes team swap
       spawn positions each round (red base is always the defense base, blue base is always
       the offense base, this option is intended for assymetrical maps, and a feature
       requested by some fans for more "assault" styled maps
       Note: 4 maps have been hardcoded as using round swap for ctfs, they are q3wc3 q3wc7 q3wcp8 q3wcp24
- add: option to select which of the multiarena maps is used in arena mode, "/callvote setarena #"
       or "setarena #" directly from the console, this vote is always active if voting is allowed

- add: ctfs roundtime cvar ( g_ctfsRoundTimeLimit, defaults to 150 which is 2.5 minutes )

       add 1024 to the gametype number to enable instagib (only for cctf atm)
       add 2048 to the gametype number to disable the runes (only in gametypes with runes, duh)
- add: cctf now spawns "bonus" quads on the losing team's flag (if the team loses by more than 1)
       every 90 seconds, should even things out
       ( g_cctfBonusQuadTime, default:90 (set to 0 to disable) )
- add: cctf now spawns you 25% of the time on the other team's respawns (might be in their base)     
       this tries to emulate q2ctf's single spawn system, where you could spawn anywhere  
- add: a small ok map i did a while ago (derean01.bsp) for another mod of mine, thought i'd include
       it, its not threewave caliber by any means...
